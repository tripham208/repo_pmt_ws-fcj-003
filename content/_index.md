# Airflow with AWS

### Overview

[Apache AirflowÂ®](https://airflow.apache.org/) is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. In this workshop,
we will learn about Apache Airflow, install it on localhost, and deploy it on AWS using MWAA.

[Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow](https://aws.amazon.com/vi/managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/) Secure
and highly available
managed workflow orchestration for Apache Airflow

- Deploy Apache Airflow at scale without the operational burden of managing underlying infrastructure.
- Run Apache Airflow workloads in your own isolated and secure cloud environment.
- Monitor environments through Amazon CloudWatch integration to reduce operating costs and engineering overhead.
- Connect to AWS, cloud, or on-premises resources through Apache Airflow providers or custom plugins.
